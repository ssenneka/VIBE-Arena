# Welcome to the VIBE Arena (Visual ICMS Behavioral Environment)
This repository contains data collected and analyzed in "Integraiton of learned artificial sensation with vision during freely-moving navigation" by Samuel Senneka and Maria Dadarlat. 
Along with the dataset, python and MATLAB scripts used for analysis are also included. 
Relevant behavior metrics are saved in csv files titled "*mouse name* all data.csv". dataanalysis_allmice.py isolates 5 behavior sessions for all mice, performs statistical analyses on the sessions analyzed, and generates plots of behavior metrics with statistical annotations.
